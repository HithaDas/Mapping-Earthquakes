# Mapping Earthquakes
Module 14  Mapping Earthquakes

# Background
Basil and Sadhana like how you created your earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. Now, Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.


This new assignment consists of three technical analysis deliverables:

Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data
Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data
Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map

# Project Overview
In this module challenge, we used the Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL. Each earthquake is visually represented by a circle and color depending on the magnitude of the earthquake, where an earthquake with higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and represented by color. The map provides additional info as a popup marker that, when clicked, shows the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake.

# Objectives
1. Create a branch from the master branch on GitHub.
2. Add, commit, and push data to a GitHub branch after completion of each deliverables.
3. Merge a branch with the master branch on GitHub.
4. Retrieve data from a GeoJSON file.
6. Populate geographical maps with GeoJSON data using JavaScript and D3 library.
7. Add map layers to maps using Leaflet.
